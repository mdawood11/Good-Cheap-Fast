## Introduction

The "Good, Cheap, Fast Toggle Project" is a creative representation of the well-known project management adage, "Good, Cheap, Fast: Pick Any Two." The project's goal is to provide users with a visually appealing and interactive way to explore the trade-offs and make choices between these three priorities.

## Features

- **Interactive Toggles:** The web application features three toggle switches, each representing one of the project priorities: Good, Cheap, and Fast. Users can click on the toggles to select their desired project priorities.

- **Trade-off Logic:** The application enforces the project management principle that only two out of the three priorities can be selected at a time. When a user selects a third priority, the application automatically adjusts the other toggles to ensure that only two priorities are chosen.

- **Visual Animations:** The toggles are accompanied by smooth and engaging animations, adding an element of fun to the user experience. The selected toggle moves with a sliding animation to its respective position.

## Usage

1. Upon opening the web application, users are presented with three toggle switches representing the project priorities: Good, Cheap, and Fast.

2. Users can click on any toggle to select their desired priority. They can only select a maximum of two toggles simultaneously.

3. If a user attempts to select a third toggle, the application will automatically adjust the other toggles to ensure that only two are selected. For example, if a user selects "Good" and "Cheap," and then clicks on "Fast," the "Good" toggle will be automatically deselected.

4. The selected toggle animates with a sliding motion to indicate the user's selection.

5. Users can experiment with different combinations of priorities to observe the trade-offs and better understand the project management principle.
